**Core value:** Users can dispatch prompts to Claude Code with zero friction via embedded terminal sessions
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

Plan: —
Status: Researching domain
Last activity: 2026-02-09 — Milestone v3.0 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### Known Gaps (Future Work)

From v2.0 (non-blocking tech debt):
- 20 skills still use hardcoded `/tmp` paths instead of Dispatch library
- Status monitoring only starts for resumed sessions (not new sessions)
- Deprecated code retained for rollback safety (removal planned v3.0)

## Session Continuity
